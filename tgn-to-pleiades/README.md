## TODOs

* __Clean up the format__. This file is just a first pass, extracted directly from the DB.
Ideally, the syntax should be cleaned up a little & format tweaked so that it displays
properly in the GitHub Web UI.

* __Flag data errors__. Inspect and flag up/correct errors in the data - such as e.g this one: `Libreville (Gabon);tgn,1090020;is:pleiades:108878`
